I"s<p>Opening a file in Linux is generally done by the help of open( ) system call. The open( ) function establishes the connection between a file and a file descriptor. It will create an open file description that refers to a file and a file descriptor that refers to that open file description. The file descriptor is used by other I/O functions to refer to the file.</p>
