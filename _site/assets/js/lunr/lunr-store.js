        "excerpt":"We all have at some point experienced permission denied error, isn’t it frustrating so let’s understand how permissions in linux work.   Linux like many other operating system is multi-user OS therefore to keep each users data safe and block unauthorized access linux enforces 2 level guard   Ownership Permission   Before we talk about how to get information about files security , to get current info about files security permission you can use ls -al this list all files and directories in current directory with its permissions and ownership details                     Let’s talk about Ownership of a file/directory   There are three types of owners   Owner : these permissions only apply to owner of a file/directory and not other users   Group : each file/directory is assigned a group, these permission affect all users in that group   Others : these are the permissions for all users which are not owner or part of group   Owner denotations   u : user/owner  g : group  o : other  a : all   Changing Ownership and Groups   To change the ownership of a file or a directory use   chown user’s-name filename   To change the group of a file or a directory use   chown group-name filename                     To change both user and group at the same time use   chown user:group filename   Now let’s talk about file/directory permissions   So Permissions are generally represented through the use of the letters r, w and x but they can also be represented numerically.   The table below gives us number for all permission types   Number      Permission Type         Symbol   0           No permission           --- 1           execute                 --x 2           write                   -w- 3           write+execute           -wx 4           read                    r-- 5           read+execute            r-x 6           read+write              rw- 7           read+write+execute      rwx   To change permission of a file/directory you can use   chmod permissions file                     In numeric mode you can change permission for all three types of user at once as each digit represents owner,group,others respectively.   While using symbolic mode you can change permission for specific user by using mathematical symbols   +   To add a permission  -   To remove a permission =   To set new permission and override older ones                     ","categories": ["linux"],
