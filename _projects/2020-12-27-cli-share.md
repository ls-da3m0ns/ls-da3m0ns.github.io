## BackStory 
Every Great project has a back story this dose to, so lets start

My daily work forces me copy lots of small document from my phone to laptop now my lazyness forces me not to use Data cable 
or some popular file sharing app like ShareIt i just use my whatsapp send a message with file attached to it and open whatsapp
 web to download it :) not the most efficient way i get it. So here is why i thought of this project i want to share my files 
 across the devices without installing apps.

<br>

## CLI share and how it solves this

CLI share leverages the fact that tools like CURL already come preinstalled in most of the devices available in this world 
yes you read it correct whole world!  not conviced allow me to explain

most of the os are either unix derivative or Windows both of them already have CURL preinstalled the only OS's which don't
have curl by default is either custom compiled OS or some over the top secure computers :) 

With CLI share you have the flexibility to share files using it's web interface of it CLI based API its really simple and straight 
forward 

Use CURL to send a POST request with your file attached to it like
``` bash
curl -F "file=@/path/to/file" clishare.ml
```

This will generate a 4 digit token and a link you can use this direct link or this 4 digit token to get your file if you choose to 
use token then this is how you get your file back 

``` bash
curl -OJ clishare.ml/{your_token} 
```

That's it this is all you need to share files across the internet safely and easily.
